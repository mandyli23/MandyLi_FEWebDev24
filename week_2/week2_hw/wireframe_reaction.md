### The main thing I took away from the wireframe reading was that I should consider who I am designing for, try and access user research that I have available to me, and create sketches while in the planning stage. For the first takeaway, knowing my audience is crucial since it helps me decide if I should design a low-fidelity wireframe or a high-fidelity wireframe. User research would give me insights into what data to represent in my work. In the planning stage, I should create basic workflows and sketches so I can consult with other people to see if my designs are up to standards.
